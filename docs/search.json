    "section": "",
    "text": "1 Introduction\nThe efficiency of using traditional energy is approaching its threshold, and may bring more costs than benefits from a macro perspective, a fact underscored by climate change challenges. Using renewable energy, such as photovoltaic and wind electricity, as a sustainable alternative to fossil fuels, is an imperative trend.\nHowever, from the standpoint of economics, environmental initiatives like renewable energy investment sometimes conflict with economic development, and these sustainability policies are often made or rejected depending on economic cost, posing significant financial challenges for developing and underdeveloped countries. Considering the advantages in technology and economics, it is reasonable for developed countries to take leading places in developing renewable energy. Additionally, there is a hypothesis called resource curse, although not universally accepted yet, suggests that countries or regions with rich natural resources experience slower growth due to corruption and competition over the resources. If the hypothesis is valid, the development of renewable energy in these regions should be stagnated by the overexploitation of natural resources.\nTo verify the hypotheses, we found the dataset on the share of modern renewables in total final energy consumption across countries from the database of the International Energy Agency. First part of the project is to show the disparity in the share of renewable energy between developed, developing, and underdeveloped countries and regions, highlighting global inequalities in renewable energy development. The second part of the project discovers factors that influence the difference in the share of using renewable energy across different countries, including GDP per capita, infrastructure, investment in renewable energy, and fossil fuel subsidy. This analysis aims to understand the reason behind the disparity in renewable energy."

    "text": "2.1 Description\n\n2.1.1 Share of Modern Renewables in Total Final Energy Consumption (%):\nIt is downloaded from the website of the International Energy Agency (IEA). It contains over 275 countries and defined regional groupings from 1990 to 2021. This database is updated annually, and the last update was on 09/15/2023. However, the most recent year with complete data recorded is 2020. A few small countries do not contain relevant data, and their share was 0 in the dataset. We decided to exclude countries with empty data and import the rest of the dataset to show the disparity of developing renewable energy by detailed breakdown across countries and regions over the years.\n[Source: iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/sdg7-database]\n\n\n2.1.2 World Energy Investment 2023:\nIt is downloaded from IEA. It contains time series data of supply energy investment, including detailed breakdowns in fossil fuels, renewables, electricity networks, and other supplies, across different countries and regions from 2015 to 2023. This dataset is updated annually, and the last update was on 5/25/2023. For our project, we will divide renewable energy by total energy in 2020 to create a column as a share of renewable energy investment proportion, to discover any effect on the share of renewable energy usage. No missing value is in selected columns.\n[Source: iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/world-energy-investment-2023-datafile-2#data-set]\n\n\n2.1.3 Fossil Fuel Subsidies:\nIt is downloaded from IEA. It contains time series data of subsidies to 4 fossil fuels, average subsidy rate, subsidy per capita, and total subsidy as a share of GDP across 55 countries in 2023. This dataset is updated annually, and the last update was on 10/24/2023. We decided to focus on the total subsidy column in 2020, and later divide it by GDP to create the feature, subsidy as a share of total GDP, to detect any influence on the share of modern renewables in corresponding countries in 2020. No missing value is in this column.\n[Source: iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/fossil-fuel-subsidies-database]\n\n\n2.1.4 Electricity Access:\nIt is downloaded from IEA. It contains time series data of the percentage of the population who get access to electricity across different countries and regions. This dataset is updated annually, and the last update was on 9/15/2023. While many countries have &gt;99% access in 2022, the Democratic Republic of the Congo only has 9%. Since it does not contain data in 2020, only data in 2015 and 2022 as nearby years, and the difference is negligible in almost all countries, we will import 2022 data to represent the situation in 2020, and discover any relationship to the share of modern renewables.\n[Source: iea.org/data-and-statistics/data-product/sdg7-database]\n\n\n2.1.5 GDP per capita:\nIt is downloaded from the website of the World Bank. It contains GDP per capita of 269 countries and defined regions from 1960 to 2022. This dataset is updated annually. Some countries like DPRK do not have data, and we will only import data of countries that have corresponding entries in the renewable energy share dataset, to find any relationship contributing to the share.\n[Source: data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD]"

    "text": "2.2 Research plan\nThe project comprises two main parts. In the first part, we aim to analyze the distribution of renewable energy usage across various countries and regions. This will be conducted on the Share of Modern Renewables in the Total Final Energy Consumption dataset. Initially, we will create a Cleveland dot plot to compare the renewable energy share of all listed countries, identifying if there are commonalities among those with high and low rankings. The dataset also includes entries for the World, Developed Regions, Developing Regions, and specific areas like Sub-Saharan Africa, Northern Europe, and Western Asia, which facilitates the creation of bar charts to depict disparities as of 2020. Besides, we plan to use time series graphs to track changes in renewable energy use from 2010 to 2020 in the selected regions.\nIn examining the resource curse hypothesis, we will focus on countries rich in natural resources but plagued by corruption and conflicts, such as certain nations in Sub-Saharan Africa and Latin America. By comparing these with the rest of the world through Cleveland dot plots or bar charts, we try to uncover evidence of the resource curse in these areas.\nThe second part of the project delves into the causes behind disparities in renewable energy usage, particularly between developed and developing countries. We’ll start by analyzing the correlation between GDP per capita and renewable energy share through scatter plots, assessing the influence of economic development on renewable energy share. Additional scatter plots will explore the relationship between renewable energy share and investment in renewables, as well as the impact of technology efficiency and fossil fuel subsidies on renewable energy development. We will test the hypothesis that countries with high investment, high efficiency, and low subsidies on traditional fossil fuels have higher motivation to develop renewable energy and hence have a higher share. Finally, to assess the influence of infrastructure on renewable energy development, since the electricity access dataset contains many countries with access &gt;99%, we can code electricity access and share of renewable energy into 5 categories: VeryHigh, High, Med, Low, ExtLow, and plot the heatmap to show the relationship.\nWhat should be noted is that since the most recent year with complete data in the renewable energy share dataset is 2020, we will only conduct analysis on data in 2020 from other datasets (except for time-series analysis)."

Besides, by looking into countries and regions with missing values greater than 1, we find that values of those entries are either missing in early times or in recent years. To be more specific, Montenegro does not have records from 1990 to 2004 and Guadeloupe does not have records from 2011 to 2021.\nThen, we draw the heatmap to get more insights. However, since there are 275 entries in the dataset, which cannot be fully presented in the graph, we choose to group countries and regions into different groups.\n\n\nCode\n# Heatmap\nsub_data = data[seq(230, 275, 1),seq(23, 32,1)]\ntidy_data &lt;- sub_data %&gt;%\n  rownames_to_column(\"id\") %&gt;%\n  gather(key, value, -id) %&gt;%\n  mutate(missing=ifelse(is.na(value), \"yes\", \"no\"))\ntidy_data &lt;- tidy_data %&gt;% group_by(key) %&gt;% \n  mutate(Std = (value-mean(value, na.rm = TRUE))/sd(value, na.rm = TRUE)) %&gt;% ungroup()\nggplot(tidy_data, aes(x = key, y = fct_rev(id), fill = Std)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") + \n  ylab('') + \n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", mid = \"white\", high =\"yellow\", na.value = \"black\") + theme_bw()\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can be seen that missing data in 2021 is the most significant pattern. Besides insights of missing data, we notice that there exists some pattern for the renewable energy proportion, which will be discussed in the future analysis.\nFinally, we draw the pattern of those missing values.\n\n\nCode\nsub_data = data[,seq(23, 32,1)]\nplot_missing(sub_data)\n\n\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\nScale for y is already present.\nAdding another scale for y, which will replace the existing scale.\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the limitation of the graph size and our focus on recent trends, we plot the pattern of missing values from 2012 to 2021. There are mainly three patterns. First, nearly 65% of countries and regions do not have records for 2021. Second, 30% of them do not have missing data for the 10-year period. Third, a small proportion of them does not have any record during the period.\nFor analysis other than the time-series one, we focus on year 2020 in the renewable energy share dataset, as well as other datasets. There are five countries or regions that have missing values in that year, and will be removed from the subsequent analysis. For other datasets we use, since we only extract a specific column from them, there is no missing value. However, when merging those datasets with the renewable energy share dataset, there can be cases that some countries do not exists in all of them. When situations like this occurs, those countries or regions in that specific analysis will be removed."

    "section": "2.4 Limitations",
    "text": "2.4 Limitations\nThere exists several limitations in our data. First, the reference of countries/regions may be inconsistent in different datasets. Since there are many methods of classifying countries into groups, it is hard to compare those groups due to their inclusion relationship. For example, United States can be classified into North America (region) and Developed Countries (economics) at the same time. Therefore, it is time-consuming to classify hundreds of countries based on a unified standard. Moreover, representation of country names can also be different, which requires manual work to convert them into the same representation. For example, United Kingdom is also referred to as United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. After searching a lot of online resources, we derived a relatively common method of classifying countries in terms of their economic, regional, and political information. Detailed steps of data preprocessing can be found in data/preprocess.qmd and data.qmd.\nThe second limitation is that some datasets do not have records in 2020. Since the focus of our analysis is on data in 2020, we need to use data in years near 2020 as an approximation, which may deviate from their true values."

This helps us understand how different countries are adopting renewable energy sources.\nTo categorize countries, we adopt the classification method used by the International Energy Agency. We define ‘Advanced economies’ as countries in the OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development) group, which includes nations collaborating on economic policies to enhance their collective prosperity. This group also comprises Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Malta, and Romania. All other nations are grouped as ‘Emerging Market and Developing Economies.’ A country’s membership in the OECD is determined based on several criteria, including its level of economic development, adherence to democratic values, and its commitment to the objectives of the OECD. This makes the OECD a significant and influential group, and it is a persuasive way to divide the countries.\n\n\nCode\nadvanced_countries &lt;- filter(renewable_country, EconomyLabel == \"Advanced Economies\")\nemerging_countries &lt;- filter(renewable_country, EconomyLabel == \"Emerging market and developing economies\")\n\n# Randomly sample half of the emerging countries\nset.seed(123)  # Setting a seed for reproducibility\nsample_size &lt;- ceiling(nrow(emerging_countries) / 2)  # Half of the emerging countries\nemerging_sampled &lt;- sample_n(emerging_countries, sample_size)\n\n# Combine the advanced countries with the sampled emerging countries\ncombined_sampled &lt;- rbind(advanced_countries, emerging_sampled)\n\n# Now create your plot\nggplot(combined_sampled, aes(x = `2020`, y = fct_reorder(CountryRegion, `2020`))) +\n  geom_point(color = 'blue') +\n  facet_wrap(~EconomyLabel, ncol = 1, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Renewable Energy Share of Each Country (Sampled)\") +\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 90, by = 10)) +\n  ylab(\"\")\n\n\n\n\n\nSince there is much more Emerging market and developing economies, we chose to randomly subset half of them and include in the Cleveland plot. The plot shows that advanced economies typically use a larger portion of renewable energy compared to other countries. Notably, Iceland and several countries in Northern Europe are leading in the use of renewable energy. However, what is surprising is that many countries in the third world also has high share of renewable energy, including Gabon, Uruguay, Brazil, and Malawi, exceed most advanced economies. Meanwhile, it’s important to note that in many of these countries, the use of renewable energy is still very minimal, close to 0%. This highlights the uneven adoption of renewable energy across different regions.\n\n\n3.2.2 What is the progress of developed, developing, underdeveloped countries in developing renewable energy over the part 30 Years?\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for specified categories\nselected_categories &lt;- filter(renewable_pct, CountryRegion %in% c(\"World\", \"Least Developed Countries (LDCs)\", \"Developing regions (MDG)\", \"Developed regions (MDG)\"))\n\n# Reshape data to long format\nselected_categories_long &lt;- pivot_longer(selected_categories, \n                                        cols = all_of(paste0(1990:2020)), \n                                        names_to = \"Year\", \n                                        values_to = \"Percentage\")\n\n# Convert both Year and Percentage to numeric\nselected_categories_long$Year &lt;- as.numeric(selected_categories_long$Year)\nselected_categories_long$Percentage &lt;- as.numeric(selected_categories_long$Percentage)\n\n# Sort data by Year\nselected_categories_long &lt;- selected_categories_long %&gt;% arrange(Year)\n\n# Create the multivariate time series plot\nggplot(selected_categories_long, aes(x = Year, y = Percentage, color = CountryRegion)) +\n  geom_line() +  # Line to connect points\n  geom_point() +  # Points for each data entry\n  ggtitle(\"Time Series of Renewable Energy Percentage in the World (1990-2020)\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Renewable Energy Percentage (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")  # Adjust legend position as needed\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s quite remarkable to look back at the 1990s and 2000s and see that the countries leading the adoption of renewable energy were primarily the Least Developed Countries, followed by Developing regions, and then Developed regions. This trend has subtle change around 2012. After years of rapidly increasing their use of renewable energy, developed countries overtook the Least Developed Countries in this area. By 2020, this pattern had completely reversed. Developed regions were now at the forefront of adopting renewable energy, but the difference is not significant yet.\n\n\n3.2.3 What about countries with share &gt;50%?

It highlights that three developed countries, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Iceland, have consistently maintained more than 50% of their energy consumption from renewable sources since 1990. This demonstrates a long-standing commitment to renewable energy in these nations. Additionally, the data shows an impressive rise in renewable energy use in two developing countries, Gabon and Uruguay, starting from 2001 and 2006 respectively. This indicates a growing shift towards renewable energy sources in these regions as well.\n\n\n3.2.4 plot with some representitive regions in the world\nFrom Cleveland Plot, countries in Northern Europe generally have high levels of renewable energy consumption, while many countries in Western Asia typically have lower levels. The disparity yields the question whether there is geographical influence on development of renewable energy. To investigate this further, we selected a few representative areas, ensuring that the countries within these regions have similar levels of economic development.\n\n\nCode\n# Filter for specified regions\nselected_regions &lt;- filter(renewable_pct, CountryRegion %in% c(\"Western Asia (M49)\", \n                                                               \"Sub-Saharan Africa (M49)\", \n                                                               \"Northern Europe (M49)\", \n                                                               \"Western Europe (M49)\", \n                                                               \"Landlocked developing countries (LLDCs)\", \n                                                               \"Small island developing States (SIDS)\", \n                                                               \"Latin America and the Caribbean (MDG=M49)\"))\n\n# Reshape data to long format\nselected_regions_long &lt;- pivot_longer(selected_regions, \n                                      cols = all_of(paste0(1990:2020)), \n                                      names_to = \"Year\", \n                                      values_to = \"Percentage\")\n\n# Convert both Year and Percentage to numeric\nselected_regions_long$Year &lt;- as.numeric(selected_regions_long$Year)\nselected_regions_long$Percentage &lt;- as.numeric(selected_regions_long$Percentage)\n\n# Sort data by Year\nselected_regions_long &lt;- selected_regions_long %&gt;% arrange(Year)\n\n# Create the multivariate time series plot\nggplot(selected_regions_long, aes(x = Year, y = Percentage, color = CountryRegion)) +\n  geom_line() +  # Line to connect points\n  geom_point() +  # Points for each data entry\n  ggtitle(\"Time Series of Renewable Energy Percentage for Selected Regions (1990-2020)\") +\n  xlab(\"Year\") +\n  ylab(\"Renewable Energy Percentage (%)\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(legend.position = \"bottom\")  # Adjust legend position as needed\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Time Series plot seems to fit the findings in the Cleveland plot. For instance, regions like Latin America and the Caribbean consistently demonstrate high renewable energy usage. In contrast, regions such as Western Asia and landlocked developing countries tend to have lower levels of renewable energy adoption. These findings spark curiosity and encourage further exploration into how different parts of the world vary in terms of renewable energy adoption. We will provide a more detailed breakdown of renewable energy trends by geolocation using interactive plots.\n\n\n3.2.5 From the Point of Renewable Energy Adoption: Is Natural Resource Curse True?\nIn our study, we explore the concept of the ‘Natural Resource Curse,’ a situation where countries with abundant natural resources often experience economic challenges like overexploitation of resources, lack of industrial diversification, and sometimes corruption and conflict over resources.\nTo examine if this hypothesis is evident in our data, we selected nine resource-rich countries and compared their average share of renewable energy usage from 2016 to 2020. These countries are categorized into three groups based on their economic and resource management status. The first group, which is commonly associated with the Natural Resource Curse, includes Venezuela, Nigeria, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The second group, where the impact of natural resource dependence is debatable, consists of Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and Russia. The third group, known for their robust economies and effective resource management, comprises Norway, Canada, and Australia.\nOur analysis is based on assumption that if the country has a low share of renewable energy, it means a heavy reliance on natural resources. This could potentially lead to economic vulnerabilities, such as fluctuating prices and a decrease in export demand.\n\n\nCode\n# Reshape the data to long format\nresource_long_data &lt;- pivot_longer(renewable_pct, \n                          cols = `2016`:`2020`, \n                          names_to = \"Year\", \n                          values_to = \"Percentage\")\n\n# Convert Year to numeric and ensure Percentage is numeric\nresource_long_data$Year &lt;- as.numeric(resource_long_data$Year)\nresource_long_data$Percentage &lt;- as.numeric(resource_long_data$Percentage)\n\n# List of countries\ncountries &lt;- c(\"Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\", \"Nigeria\", \n               \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\", \"Saudi Arabia\", \n               \"Qatar\", \"Russian Federation\", \"Norway\", \"Canada\", \"Australia\")\n\n# Filter for specified countries and years\nfiltered_data &lt;- resource_long_data %&gt;%\n  filter(CountryRegion %in% countries, \n         Year %in% 2016:2020)\n\n# Calculate the average of 2016-2020 for each country\nresource_average_data &lt;- filtered_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(CountryRegion) %&gt;%\n  summarize(AveragePercentage = mean(Percentage, na.rm = TRUE)) # na.rm = TRUE to ignore NA values\n\n# Define labels\nresource_average_data$Label &lt;- ifelse(resource_average_data$CountryRegion %in% \n                               c(\"Venezuela (Bolivarian Republic of)\", \"Nigeria\", \n                                 \"Democratic Republic of the Congo\"),\n                             \"suffer\",\n                             ifelse(resource_average_data$CountryRegion %in% \n                                      c(\"Saudi Arabia\", \"Qatar\", \"Russian Federation\"),\n                                    \"uncertain\",\n                                    \"exempt\"))\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(resource_average_data, aes(x = CountryRegion, y = AveragePercentage, fill = Label)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = position_dodge()) +\n  facet_wrap(~ Label, scales = \"free_x\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Average Renewable Energy Percentage by Country and Label (2016-2020)\") +\n  xlab(\"Country\") +\n  ylab(\"Average Renewable Energy Percentage\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1))\n\n\n\n\n\nThe graph in our study confirms our hypothesis: Australia, Canada, and Norway, despite being rich in natural resources, show a high adoption of renewable energy. This indicates a successful balance between resource wealth and sustainable energy practices. Following these are countries that appear to suffer from the Natural Resource Curse. Notably, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, despite their wealth, have made almost no progress in developing renewable energy. This observation suggests that policymakers in these countries may need to reconsider their approach towards sustainable development."

It is often assumed that countries with robust economies would naturally lead in renewable energy development. However, our scatter plot analysis cannot prove it. There is no significant positive correlation between a country’s economic development and its progress in renewable energy. This finding suggests that the advancement of renewable energy is not necessarily dependent on a country’s economic status. We need to find other key determinants.\n\n\n3.3.2 Factor 2: Access to Electricity\nAccess to energy is a multifaceted concept, encompassing technical availability, adequacy, reliability, convenience, safety, and affordability. Central to this is access to electricity, which is crucial for any nation’s development. Anyone may ask, if a country do not have access to electricity, how can it start develop renewable energy?\n\n\nCode\nmerged_electricity_renewable &lt;- left_join(renewable_country, electricity, by = c(\"CountryRegion\" = \"Region\"))\n\ncleaned_merged_electricity_renewable &lt;- na.omit(merged_electricity_renewable)\n\n\n\n\nCode\n# Step 1: Convert \"&gt;99%\" to 1\ncleaned_merged_electricity_renewable &lt;- cleaned_merged_electricity_renewable %&gt;%\n  mutate(`2022` = ifelse(`2022` == \"&gt;99%\", 1, `2022`))\n\n# Step 2: Ensure the '2022' column is numeric\ncleaned_merged_electricity_renewable$`2022` &lt;- as.numeric(cleaned_merged_electricity_renewable$`2022`)\n\n# Step 3: Categorize the '2022' column\ncleaned_merged_electricity_renewable_category &lt;- cleaned_merged_electricity_renewable %&gt;%\n  mutate(\n    electricity_level = case_when(\n      `2022` &gt;= 0.99 ~ \"ALL\",\n      `2022` &lt; 0.2 ~ \"EXTLOW\",\n      `2022` &gt;= 0.2 & `2022` &lt; 0.4 ~ \"VLOW\",\n      `2022` &gt;= 0.4 & `2022` &lt; 0.6 ~ \"LOW\",\n      `2022` &gt;= 0.6 & `2022` &lt; 0.8 ~ \"MED\",\n      `2022` &gt;= 0.8 & `2022` &lt; 0.99 ~ \"HIGH\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Uncategorized\"\n    ),\n    renewable_level = case_when(\n      `2020` &gt;= 30 ~ \"VHIGH\",\n      `2020` &gt;= 16 & `2020` &lt; 30 ~ \"HIGH\",\n      `2020` &gt;= 8 & `2020` &lt; 16 ~ \"MED\",\n      `2020` &gt;= 2 & `2020` &lt; 8 ~ \"LOW\",\n      `2020` &lt; 2 ~ \"VLOW\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Uncategorized\"\n    )\n  )\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncleaned_merged_electricity_renewable_category$electricity_level &lt;- factor(\n  cleaned_merged_electricity_renewable_category$electricity_level,\n  levels = c(\"EXTLOW\", \"VLOW\", \"LOW\", \"MED\", \"HIGH\", \"ALL\")\n)\n\ncleaned_merged_electricity_renewable_category$renewable_level &lt;- factor(\n  cleaned_merged_electricity_renewable_category$renewable_level,\n  levels = c(\"VLOW\", \"LOW\", \"MED\", \"HIGH\", \"VHIGH\")\n)\n\n# Summarizing the data\nheatmap_data &lt;- cleaned_merged_electricity_renewable_category %&gt;%\n  group_by(electricity_level, renewable_level) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n(), .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Creating the heatmap with ordered categories\nggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = electricity_level, y = renewable_level, fill = Count)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightpink\", high = \"darkred\") +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Electricity Level vs Renewable Level\",\n       x = \"Electricity Level\",\n       y = \"Renewable Level\",\n       fill = \"Country Count\") +\n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nSince the included countries in Electricity dataset has many country with electricity access ‘&gt;99%’, we decided to code the electricity to 6 levels. Similarly, we classified the share of renewable energy into five different levels. Then, we count how many countries fall within the levels.\nOur heatmap analysis yielded another unexpected insight: countries with nearly universal access to electricity is most likely to have a very low level of renewable energy share. There is no clear pattern linking electricity access and renewable energy adoption. Since our dataset primarily includes countries from the developing world, this suggests that while some of these nations may have addressed basic infrastructure issues, they have not necessarily made significant strides in developing renewable energy. This finding is crucial as it highlights that solving infrastructure problems does not automatically lead to renewable energy development.\n\n\n3.3.3 Factor 3: Investment to Renewable Energy\nNext, we plan to assess the impact of government policy on renewable energy development by analyzing the percentage of investment in renewable energy out of the total energy investments.\n\n\nCode\nmerged_gdp_renewable &lt;- merged_gdp_renewable %&gt;%\n  mutate(Region_Label = case_when(\n    `Country Name` %in% c(\"China\", \"China, Hong Kong Special Administrative

by data availability, as we only have information on renewable energy investments for 11 regions. Despite this limitation, the data from these regions indicate a positive relationship between investment in renewable energy and its share in the energy mix. This suggests that investments in renewable energy are effectively translating into real-world increases in renewable energy usage.\n\n\n3.3.4 Factor 4: Subsidy to Fossil Fuel\nThe final factor we consider is the subsidy provided to fossil fuels. Typically, countries focused on developing renewable energy offer incentives to related industries and impose restrictions on traditional fossil fuels. Consequently, countries with higher subsidies for fossil fuels might experience stagnant progress in renewable energy development.\n\n\nCode\nmerged_subsidy_renewable &lt;- left_join(renewable_country, subsidy_pct, by = c(\"CountryRegion\" = \"Country\"))\ncleaned_merged_subsidy_renewable &lt;- na.omit(merged_subsidy_renewable)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nggplot(cleaned_merged_subsidy_renewable, aes(x = `Total subsidy as share of GDP (%)`, y = `2020`)) +\n  geom_point() +  # Add points\n  ggtitle(\"Total subsidy to fossil fuel as share of GDP vs Renewable Energy Percentage\") +\n  xlab(\"subsidy to fossil fuel / GDP (%)\") +\n  ylab(\"Renewable Energy Percentage (%)\") +\n  geom_text(aes(label = CountryRegion), \n            vjust = -0.5, hjust = 0.5, \n            check_overlap = TRUE, \n            size = 3, \n            nudge_x = 0.01, nudge_y = 0.01) +  \n  theme_minimal()\n\n\n\n\n\nWe visualize the impact of subsidies by dividing them by the GDP. The plot clearly shows that countries with a higher proportion of GDP allocated to fossil fuel subsidies tend to have a lower percentage of renewable energy. This indicates that policy plays a significant role in the development of renewable energy."
