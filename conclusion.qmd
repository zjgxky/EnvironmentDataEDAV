# Conclusion

Our study reveals some surprising insights about renewable energy adoption. Surprisingly, the share of renewable energy in a country's total energy consumption is not directly related to its economic or infrastructure development. We have observed significant disparities in renewable energy development across the globe. Regions like Northern Europe, Latin America, and the Caribbean have high shares of renewable energy, while others, such as Western Asia, lag behind.

Additionally, our research supports the concept of the 'Natural Resource Curseâ€™. Countries experiencing a decline in renewable energy development possess potential risks in their economic structures. In contrast, those with a higher share of renewable energy tend to be less dependent on traditional fossil fuels, indicating a more diversified and resilient economic framework, which generally translates to better real-world economic performance.

Furthermore, our findings highlight the pivotal role of policymakers in the advancement of renewable energy. High investment in renewable energy and reduced subsidies for fossil fuels are key factors in promoting renewable energy development. Therefore, for a more sustainable future, it is crucial for governments and businesses to collaborate and implement effective, sustainable strategies.
